# Analysis Based on Launch Date and Funding Goals

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to give Louise an analysis on how launch dates and funding goals impacted campaign outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the second deliverable, I categorized the funding goals into ranges separating the data by number successful, failed and canceled; total projects; and percentage successful, failed, and canceled. I then used the COUNTIFS function to sum up the number of play campains successful, failed, and canceled, within each goal range. From there I calculated the percentage using the total number of campaigns and created a line chart from that data.

From there I calculated the percentage using the total number of campaigns and created a line chart from that data. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
On the second deliverble when using the COUNTIFS, I missed adding the criteria for the plays and this greatly affected the way my line chart looked. I had to go back and add that criteria to each individual formula which was tedious.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From the analysis of outcomes based on date, it is evident that theater campaigns that launched during May experrienced a siginficantly greater success rate than other months. There is a slight correlation in the trends of both successful and failed campaigns. The both dip and rise following similar pattern.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the analysis of outcomes based on goals we can tell that campaigns with an goal of less than $1000 the highest chance of being successful. - 

What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of this dataset is that it does not take into consideration the total amaount of time the campaigns ran for. Date ended was not considered, but it could impact the success rate of a campain. A campaign that was open for two months has an advantage over one that was open for just a week. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- To resolve this limitation, I would suggest a stacked bar chart that shows successful, failed, and canceled campaigns by the number of weeks they ran.
